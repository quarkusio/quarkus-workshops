= Quarkus Augmentation

Let's demystify all this.

So far, you have developed the superheroes microservice.
This microservice is relatively simple, but it still has database access, ORM support, transaction, JSON serialization, and deserialization.

Let's now package this application using:

[source, shell]
----
$ mvn package
----

In the log, you can see actions happening at build time during what Quarkus call the _augmentation_ phase.

[source, shell]
----
[INFO] --- quarkus-maven-plugin:1.3.0.Final:build (default) @ rest-hero ---

[INFO] [org.hibernate.Version] HHH000412: Hibernate Core {5.4.5.Final}
[INFO] [io.quarkus.deployment.QuarkusAugmentor] Quarkus augmentation completed in 2653ms
----

In this log, you can see that the Hibernate XML parser has been executed at build time.
This saves from having to:

1. embed an XML parser at runtime,
2. Do the actual parsing,
3. Configure Hibernate based on the content of the file.

With Quarkus, at runtime, almost everything is already configured.
Only runtime configuration properties are applied at startup (such as database URLs).

Also, during this augmentation, Java classes are generated or extended.
Remember the `Hero` Panache entity.
The class is extended during the _augmentation_.
If you run `javap target/transformed-classes/io/quarkus/workshop/superheroes/hero/Hero.class`, you can see methods prefixed with `$$`, which have been added to the class.

If now you look at the `target/wiring-classes/io/quarkus/workshop/superheroes/hero`, you can see many generated classes.

All these metadata are computed and managed by _extensions_.
The next figure present some of the extension you already used, but there are a lot more.
We are going to learn more about extensions later in this workshop, and even build one.
What's important to understand for now is that the magic is packaged into extension and every time you add a `quarkus-` dependency to your `pom.xml` file, you enable an extension.
