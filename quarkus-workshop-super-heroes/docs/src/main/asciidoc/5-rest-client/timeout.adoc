= Timeout

Sometimes invoking a REST API can take a long time.
In fact, the more microservices invoke other microservices, the more network latency you can have.
And what happens when a HTTP request takes long?
Well, if hangs.
On your browser you can see the request pending if you turn on the dev tools and look at what's the network is doing.

== Adding Timeouts

Getting random fighters can take longer than expected.

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

To simulate a long-running process, add the following code to the `FightResource`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@ConfigProperty(name = "process.milliseconds", defaultValue = "0")
long tooManyMilliseconds;

private void veryLongProcess() {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(tooManyMilliseconds);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    }
}

@GET
@Path("/randomfighters")
@Timeout(500) // <-- Added
public Response getRandomFighters() {
    veryLongProcess(); // <-- Added
    Fighters fighters = service.findRandomFighters();
    logger.debug("Get random fighters " + fighters);
    return Response.ok(fighters).build();
}
----

[NOTE]
--
Don't forget to add the following import: `import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;` and `import org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.Timeout;`
--

Let's say we've added some new functionality in the `veryLongProcess` method.
When the process is really too long and the system is overloaded, we would rather time out.

Note that the timeout was configured to 250 ms, and a `Thread.sleep` was introduced and can be configured in the `application.properties`.
If we set the property to a higher value than the timeout, let's say 10.000, then the request should be interrupted.

process.milliseconds=10000

== Running the Application

Now that you have set the number of waiting milliseconds to 10.000, run the application and start fighting again.
You should see the following:

[source,text]
----

Before going further, set the `process.milliseconds` to 0.
