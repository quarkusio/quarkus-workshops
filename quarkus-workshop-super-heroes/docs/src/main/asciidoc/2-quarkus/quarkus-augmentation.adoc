= Quarkus Augmentation

Let's demystify all this.

So far, you have developed the superheroes microservice.
This microservice is relatively simple.
It still has database access, ORM support, transaction, JSON serialization, and deserialization.

Let's now package this application using:

[source, shell]
----
$ ./mvnw package
----

In the log, you can see actions happening during what Quarkus calls the _augmentation_ phase.

[source, shell]
----
[INFO] --- quarkus-maven-plugin:2.2.3.Final:build (default) @ rest-villains ---
[INFO] [org.jboss.threads] JBoss Threads version 3.4.2.Final
[INFO] [org.hibernate.Version] HHH000412: Hibernate ORM core version 5.5.7.Final
[INFO] [io.quarkus.deployment.QuarkusAugmentor] Quarkus augmentation completed in 1932ms
----

In this log, you can observe the _build_ principle.
Typically, about Hibernate, it saves from having to:

1. embed an XML parser at runtime,
2. Do the actual parsing,
3. Configure Hibernate based on the content of the file.

With Quarkus, at runtime, almost everything is already configured.
Only runtime configuration properties are applied at startup (such as database URLs).

Also, during this augmentation, Java classes are generated or extended.
Remember the `Villain` Panache entity.
The class is extended during the _augmentation_.
If you run `javap --class-path target/quarkus-app/quarkus/transformed-bytecode.jar io.quarkus.workshop.superheroes.villain.Villain`, you can see methods prefixed with `$$` added to the class.

Each _extension_ can combine build time and run time.
The following figure presents some of the extensions you already used, but there are a lot more.
We are going to learn more about extensions later in this workshop and even build one.
What's important to understand for now is that the magic is packaged into extension, and every time you add a `quarkus-` dependency to your `pom.xml` file, you enable an extension.
