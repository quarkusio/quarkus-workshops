= From Microservice to Microservices

'''

So far we've built two microservices: the villains and heroes microservices.
In the following sections you will develop an extra microservice: a _fight_ microservice where heroes and villains fight.
We will also add a React front-end, so we can fight graphically.
But as you can notice in the diagram below, these microservices still not communicate with each other.
You will have to wait the next chapter for that ;o)

Each microservice is developed in its own directory.

In the following sections, you will:

* Create a new Quarkus application

IMPORTANT: This service is exposed on the port 8082.
