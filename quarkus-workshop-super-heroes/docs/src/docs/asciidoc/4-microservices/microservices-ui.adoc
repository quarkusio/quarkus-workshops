[[microservices-ui]]
= User Interface

Now that we have the three main microservices, time to have a decent user interface to start fighting.
The purpose of this workshop is not to develop a web interface and learn _yet another web framework_.
This time you will just execute another Quarkus instance with an already developed and packaged Angular application.
If you want to try to build it yourself, you will have optional steps to follow.

== The Web Application

Navigate to the `super-heroes/ui-super-heroes` directory.
It contains the code of the application.
Being an Angular application, you will find a `package.json` file which defines all the needed dependencies.
All the Angular code (graphical components, model, services) is located under `src/app`.
But what's really important is the packaged application under `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources`.

IMPORTANT: This service is exposed on the port 8080.

== Running the Web Application

As usual, use `mvn quarkus:dev` to start the web application.

Be sure you have the hero, villain and fights microservices running (dev mode is enough).

Once the application is started, go to http://localhost:8080 (8080 is the default Quarkus port as we didn't change it in the `application.properties` this time).
It should display the main web page.

Oups, not working yet!
Not even the pictures, we must have been forgotten something!
Let's move on to the next section then and make the application work.

== (optional) Installing the Web Application on Quarkus

If you want to build the Angular application yourself, you can follow these optional steps (otherwise just jump to the next section).
Notice that there is a `pom.xml` file.
This is just a convenient way to install NodeJS and NPM so we can build the Angular application with Maven (optional).
The `pom.xml` also allows us to package the Angular application into Quarkus.
Thanks to the `frontend-maven-plugin` plugin declared on the `pom.xml`, we can use a good old Maven command to install and build this Angular application.

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Execute `mvn install -Pbuild-ui` and Maven will download and install Node JS and NPM and build the application.
You should now have a `node_modules` directory with all the Angular dependencies.

To install the Angular application into a Quarkus instance, we just build the app and copy the bundles under the `resources/META-INF/resources` directory.

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Run:

[source,shell]
----
export DEST=src/main/resources/META-INF/resources
./node_modules/.bin/ng build --configuration production --base-href "."
rm -Rf ${DEST}
cp -R dist/* ${DEST}
----

You will see all the Javascript files under `resources/META-INF/resources` directory.
We are now ready to go.

[WARNING]
====
If the `ng` command does not work because it can't find `node`, there is a little hack to solve it.
Open the file `ui-super-heroes/node_modules/.bin/ng` and change the shebang line from `#!/usr/bin/env node` to `#!/usr/bin/env ./node/node`.
This way `ng` knows it has to use NodeJS installed under the `ui-super-heroes/node` directory
