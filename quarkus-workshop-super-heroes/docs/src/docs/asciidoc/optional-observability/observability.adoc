Now that we have several microservices, observing them starts to be a bit tricky:
we can't just look at the logs of all the microservices to see if they are up and running or behaving correctly.
In the following sections you will add health checks and several metrics to the Fight, Hero and Villain APIs and gather them within Prometheus.

In the following sections, you will learn how to:

* Add health checks to our microservices
// TODO once metrics and Prometheus are added
//* Add metrics
//* Use Quarkus and PicoCLI to load our system
//* Monitor the entire system with Prometheus
//
//IMPORTANT: Prometheus is exposed on the port 9090.
