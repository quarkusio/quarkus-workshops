= Welcome
Let's start from the beginning.
Quarkus.
What's Quarkus?
That's a pretty good question and probably a good start.
If you go to the https://quarkus.io[Quarkus web site], you'll read that Quarkus is "_A Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for OpenJDK HotSpot & GraalVM, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards_."
This description is somewhat unclear but does an outstanding job at using bankable keywords.
It's also written: "_Supersonic Subatomic Java_."
This is a way of saying that Quarkus is really fast, and it’s really light.
But what does Quarkus _do_?

In practice, Quarkus is a stack to develop distributed systems and modern applications in Java, Kotlin, or Scala.
Quarkus applications are tailored for the Cloud, containers, and Kubernetes.
That does not mean you can't use Quarkus in other environments, there are no limits, but the principles infused in Quarkus have made containerization of applications more efficient.
In this workshop, we will explain what Quarkus is and because the best way to understand Quarkus is to use it, build a set of microservices with it.
Again, Quarkus is not limited to microservices, but it's a generally well-understood type of architecture.

This workshop offers attendees an intro-level, hands-on session with Quarkus, from the first line of code to making services, to consuming them, and finally to assembling everything in a consistent system.
But, what are we going to build?
Well, it's going to be a set of microservices:

* Using Quarkus
* Using blocking and non-blocking HTTP invocations
* With some parts of the dark side of microservices (resilience, health, etc)
ifdef::use-messaging[]
* Use a event-based architecture using Apache Kafka
endif::use-messaging[]
ifdef::use-ai[]
* Use OpenAI to introduce some artificial intelligence
endif::use-ai[]
* Answer the ultimate question: are super-heroes stronger than super-villains?

This workshop is a BYOL (_Bring Your Own Laptop_) session, so bring your Windows, OSX, or Linux laptop.
You just need JDK {jdk-version} on your machine and Docker (having Apache Maven {maven-version} installed is optional as you will rely on the Apache Maven Wrapper).
ifdef::use-mac,use-windows[]
On Mac and Windows, Docker for _x_ is recommended instead of the Docker toolbox setup.
endif::[]

What you are going to learn:

* What is Quarkus, and how you can use it
* How to build an HTTP endpoint (REST API) with Quarkus
* How to access a relational database
* How you can use Swagger and OpenAPI
* How you test your microservice
* How to build a reactive microservice, including reactive data access
* How you improve the resilience of your service
ifdef::use-ai[]
* How to invoke OpenAI/Azure OpenAI APIs using Semantic Kernel
endif::use-ai[]
ifdef::use-messaging[]
* How to build event-driven microservices with Kafka
endif::use-messaging[]
ifdef::use-native[]
* How to build native executable
endif::use-native[]
ifdef::use-kubernetes[]
* How to deploy the microservices to Kubernetes
endif::use-kubernetes[]
ifdef::use-observability[]
* How to monitor your microservices with Prometheus
endif::use-observability[]
ifdef::use-extension[]
* How to extend Quarkus with extensions
endif::use-extension[]
* And much more!
