= Sending Events on WebSockets

At this point, you read the _fights_ from Kafka and computes statistics.
Actually, even if you start the application, nothing will happen as nobody consumes these statistics.

In this section, we are going to consume these statistics and send them to two WebSockets.
For this, we are going to add two classes and a simple presentation page:

* `TeamStatsWebSocket`
* `TopWinnerWebSocket`
* `index.html`

Quarkus uses the http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=356[JSR 356] providing an annotation-driven approach to implement WebSockets.

== The TeamStats WebSocket

[example, role="cta"]
--

Create the `io.quarkus.workshop.superheroes.statistics.TeamStatsWebSocket` class with the following content:

[source,java]
----
include::{projectdir}/event-statistics/src/main/java/io/quarkus/workshop/superheroes/statistics/TeamStatsWebSocket.java[tag=!adocJavadoc]
----
--

This component is a WebSocket as specified by the `@ServerEndpoint("/stats/team")` annotation.
It handles the `/stats/team` WebSocket.

When a client (like a browser) connects to the WebSocket, it keeps track of the session.
This session is released when the client disconnects.

The `TeamStatsWebSocket` also injects a `Multi` attached to the `team-stats` channel.
After creation, the component subscribes to this stream and broadcasts the fights to the different clients connected to the web socket.

The _subscription_ is an essential part of the stream lifecycle.
It indicates that someone is interested in the items transiting on the stream, and it triggers the emission.
In this case, it triggers the connection to Kafka and starts receiving the messages from Kafka.
Without it, items would not be emitted.

== The TopWinner WebSocket

The `io.quarkus.workshop.superheroes.statistics.TopWinnerWebSocket` follows the same pattern but subscribes to the `winner-stats` channel.

[example, role="cta"]
--

Create the `io.quarkus.workshop.superheroes.statistics.TopWinnerWebSocket` with the following content:

[source,java]
----
include::{projectdir}/event-statistics/src/main/java/io/quarkus/workshop/superheroes/statistics/TopWinnerWebSocket.java[tag=!adocJavadoc]
----
--

Because the items (top 10) need to be serialized, the `TopWinnerWebSocket` also use Jackson to transform the object into a serialized form.

== The UI

Finally, you need a UI to watch these live statistics.

[example, role="cta"]
--

Replace the `META-INF/resources/index.html` file with the following content:

[source,html]
----
include::{projectdir}/event-statistics/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/index.html[]
----
--

== Running the Application

You are all set!

[example, role="cta"]
--

Time to start the application using:

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw quarkus:dev
----

Then, open `http://localhost:8085` in a new browser window.
Trigger some fights, and you should see the live statistics moving.

Quarkus automatically reuse the Kafka broker from the fight service.
So, make sure the fight service is started.
